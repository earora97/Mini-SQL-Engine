---------DONE---------

table1 -> name of first table as string
table2_exists -> boolean true if table 2 exists
table2 -> name of table2 if it exists
andFlag -> boolen true if there is "AND" in the where clause
orFlag -> boolena true if there is "OR" in the where clause

---------DONE---------

table1_where ->
* list that contains the conditions in where clause that have attributes of only table1
* the length of the list should be equal to the number of conditions it contains
* it is a list of structs, the struct type is this:
    say conditions is x op y
    attr1_index -> index (starting from 1) of the attribute to the left of equal (here x) (as a string)
    operator -> the op (as a string)
    second_val -> if y is an attribute of tabe1 then second_val stores the index of y, else it stores y (as a string)
    flag -> true if y is an attribute of table1
table2_where -> same as table1_where

NOTE : for aggregate functions what do u suggest, usign a flag for everyone like maxFlag, minFlag, sumFlag, avgFlag or somethign else
table_double_where ->
same as table1_where with these changes:
    *instead of second_val we have attr2_index
    *no flag

HIGHLIGHT HIGHLIGHT!!! FORGOT TO MENTION 2 VERY IMPORTANT VARIABLES
table1_print_attributes -> list of column index (not coulmn name, index starts with 1) of table1 which are to be printed
table2_print_attributes -> list of column index (not coulmn name, index starts with 1) of table2 which are to be printed
